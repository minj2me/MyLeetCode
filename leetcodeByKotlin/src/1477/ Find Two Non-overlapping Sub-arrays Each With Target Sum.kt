/**
 * 1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-two-non-overlapping-sub-arrays-each-with-target-sum/description/
 *
 * Given an array of integers arr and an integer target.
You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with sum equal target.
There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.
Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.

Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
1 <= target <= 10^8

class Solution {
    fun minSumOfLengths(arr: IntArray, target: Int): Int {
        return 0
    }
