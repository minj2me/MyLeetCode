 * 
 * Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.
Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. 

For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid. 
On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.

Example 1:
Input:
        1
       / \
      2   3
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
